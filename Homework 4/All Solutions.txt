Douglas Mansell
Process: I chose to create each hole, assign their connected holes, and then check each hole
see if it's filled, and check the potential jumps it could have. If there is a empty hole 
on the otherside of a connected filled hole, it will jump.

The jump selection is randomized, so it doesn't start from hole 0 and run down each time.
It starts from a random hole between 0 and 14.

Data structures:
List of holes.
Holes connected via graph.
